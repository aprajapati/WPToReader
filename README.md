WPToReader
==========

WP8 Client for sendtoreader.com

WP option for Amazon's send to kindle service. 

This is the first version, using sendtoreader.com API's to post document to their webservice. You must need sendtoreader.com account. This app is just a client. Webservice is hosted by sendtoreader.com

Future plans: 
1) Add offline support 
2) Add ablility to share url from any other app using OS sharing options. IMO WP API's does not support it as of now.

This is my first attempt to write WP code. Any suggestions/improvments are most welcome.
